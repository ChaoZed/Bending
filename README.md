# Bending

## Requirements
- `Java 8 or newer`

Bending is a **PaperMc** specific implementation for Bending in minecraft.
The original bending plugin (TLA) and its successor (ProjectKorra) have laid the foundations for bending in minecraft.
Some concepts of this plugin are based on [Atlacore's](https://github.com/plushmonkey/atlacore) implementations.
This plugin has been architectured from the ground up and aims to provide a robust and clean codebase while avoiding past mistakes.
A secondary goal is offering a bigger range of features while focusing on canon and balanced bending with the hope of reigniting competitive bending servers.

## WIP
This plugin is at an early development stage.
Almost every core system is ready and functioning.
Some things still need to be tested and polished (presets and command feedback for example).
The next logical step is slowly implementing abilities (fireblast, airswipe and a couple passives are already included and can serve as an example).
